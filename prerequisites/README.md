# Pre-Requisites

## Google Cloud
- GCP Account
- GCP Project
- GCP BigQuery Dataset to hold the tables that are being created
- GCP Cloud Storage (GCS) bucket to hold the census data tables 

You can open your account and start your first project at https://cloud.google.com/free

Google have two overlapping 'free' programmes:
- [Free Trial](https://cloud.google.com/free/docs/free-cloud-features#free-trial): $300 to spend in 90 days for new customers
- [Free Tier](https://cloud.google.com/free/docs/free-cloud-features#free-tier): for 20 Google Cloud services (including BigQuery and Cloud Storgae), there is a certain amount of activity that will be free each month, regardless or not of the Free Trial status. This demonstration can be accomplished easily within that free tier even if your Free Trial has expired.
