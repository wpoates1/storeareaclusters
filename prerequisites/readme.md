Google have two overlapping 'free' programmes:
- [Free Trial](https://cloud.google.com/free/docs/free-cloud-features#free-trial): $300 to spend in 90 days for new customers
- [Free Tier](https://cloud.google.com/free/docs/free-cloud-features#free-tier): for 20 Google Cloud services (including BigQuery and Cloud Storgae), there is a certain amount of activity that will be free each month, regardless or not of the Free Trial status.
